# Hands-on-ML
A few exercises made studying the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn &amp; TensorFlow, by Aurelien Geron

What you will find in these files:

- **E3.1:** A MNIST Classifier based on KNN, using Grid Search to stablish the better parameters for the data
- **E3.4:** A SPAM Classifier. Taking emails text files, the notebook handles the data, removing unnecessary information and transforming the text into vectors, where each instance represents the number of time a word has appeared. For that, the program stablishes a common vocabulary for all e-mails. Once that's done, a Logistic Regressor can be called to make predictions on wheter some e-mail will be SPAM or not.
